    <p>Swimming in our crystal clear blue waters is an experience second to none. Certification is required to dive, but even if you've never dived before, our brief introductory PADI Resort Certification program* will have you experiencing a whole new underwater world that same day. With top-of-the-line equipment, state-of-the-art Newton Dive Boats, a PADI® certified staff and unparalleled dive locations, it's no wonder Sandals has been voted one of the Top 5 Dive Operations in the Western Hemisphere by PADI®.
